Approach
This problem can be broken down into three simple sub problems and can be solve sequentially to arrive at our final solution.

Finding the mid: take slow and fast ptr and find the start of the second half of Linked List
Reverse Linked List: reverse the second half and split the original Linked list into two independent linked list
Merge Linked List: take each node one by one from both the sublists and merge them into single linked list.
